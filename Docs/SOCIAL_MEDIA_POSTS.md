### Option 4: Problem-Solution
```
Context drift is killing your AI coding workflow.

You spend hours explaining your architecture to Cursor/Claude Code, then it forgets mid-conversation.

Voco V2's Logic Ledger prevents this with persistent decision tracking.

Voice-native + sub-300ms + local-first.

### Option 1: Thoughtful Analysis
```
I've been following the voice coding space closely, and there's an interesting dynamic emerging between general productivity tools like Willow and specialized developer tools like Voco V2.

Willow (YC X25) is crushing it with voice dictation—4x faster typing, works everywhere, $15/month. Perfect for emails, Slack, and rapid AI prompts. Their testimonials speak for themselves.

But there's a deeper problem Willow doesn't solve: context drift.

As a developer using Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Code, you've experienced this:
- You spend 20 minutes explaining your microservices architecture
- The AI generates code perfectly
- 30 minutes later, it forgets your design decisions
- You start over, wasting hours

This is where Voco V2 comes in.

Voco V2 isn't a dictation tool—it's a voice-native orchestrator with a persistent "Logic Ledger" that tracks every architectural decision. It's built for expert developers who need:

✅ Sub-300ms voice latency (faster than Willow)
✅ Barge-in support (interrupt mid-response)
✅ Local-first security (zero-trust Tauri sandbox)
✅ Multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph state machine)
✅ Voice-native PR reviews

The ideal workflow? Use BOTH:
- Willow for emails, Slack, rapid prompts (speed layer)
- Voco V2 for coding, architecture, PR reviews (context layer)

### Option 2: Direct Comparison
```
Voice coding is exploding in 2026, and two tools are leading the way:

🎙️ Willow: Universal voice dictation
🧠 Voco V2: Voice-native AI orchestrator

Here's how they compare:

**Willow (YC X25)**
✅ 200ms latency (fastest dictation)
✅ Works in any app (Gmail, Slack, Cursor)
✅ $15/month, SOC 2/HIPAA compliant
✅ 4x faster than typing
❌ No context persistence
❌ No multi-agent orchestration

**Voco V2 (Beta)**
✅ <150ms latency (sub-300ms voice-to-voice)
✅ Logic Ledger (persistent architectural decisions)
✅ Multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph)
✅ Local-first security (Tauri sandbox)
✅ Voice-native PR reviews
❌ Developer-specific (not general productivity)
❌ Steeper learning curve

**The Verdict:**
They're not competitors—they're complementary.

Use Willow for speed (emails, Slack, rapid prompts)
Use Voco V2 for context (coding, architecture, PR reviews)

If you're a developer using Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Code, you'll want both in your workflow.

### Option 3: Story-Driven
```
Last week, I spent 3 hours rebuilding code because my AI agent forgot my architecture mid-conversation.

Sound familiar?

This is "context drift"—when AI tools like Cursor or Claude Code lose track of your design decisions, forcing you to re-explain everything.

It's the #1 complaint I hear from developers using AI coding assistants.

Voice tools like Willow (YC X25) solve the SPEED problem—typing is slow, dictation is 4x faster. Willow is phenomenal at this. I use it for emails and Slack.

But Willow doesn't solve the CONTEXT problem.

That's why we built Voco V2: a voice-native orchestrator with a "Logic Ledger" that never forgets your architectural decisions.

Here's what makes it different:

🎯 Persistent Context: Every design decision is tracked in a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
⚡ Sub-300ms Latency: Faster than typing, faster than thinking
🔒 Local-First Security: Zero-trust Tauri sandbox, no cloud dependency
🎙️ Voice-Native PR Reviews: Discuss code changes in real-time via voice
🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration: Manage multiple AI agents with LangGraph

The workflow is simple:
1. Use Willow for emails, Slack, rapid prompts (speed)
2. Use Voco V2 for coding, architecture, PR reviews (context)

Both tools, one workflow.

1/8 🧵 Voice coding is exploding in 2026.

Two tools are leading: Willow and Voco V2.

But they're NOT competitors—they solve different problems.

Here's why you might need both:

---

2/8 Willow (YC X25) solves the SPEED problem.

Typing is slow (40 WPM). Voice is fast (150 WPM).

Willow gives you:
✅ 200ms latency
✅ Works anywhere (Gmail, Slack, Cursor)
✅ $15/month
✅ SOC 2/HIPAA compliance

Perfect for emails, prompts, docs.

---

3/8 But Willow doesn't solve the CONTEXT problem.

If you're a developer using Cursor/Claude Code, you know this pain:

You explain your architecture → AI generates code → 30 mins later, it forgets everything.

This is "context drift," and it's killing productivity.

---

4/8 Voco V2 solves context drift with a "Logic Ledger."

Every architectural decision is tracked in a persistent DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

The AI never forgets your design choices—even across multiple sessions.

---

5/8 Voco V2 isn't a dictation tool—it's an AI orchestrator.

Features:
✅ <150ms latency (faster than Willow)
✅ Barge-in support (interrupt mid-response)
✅ Local-first security (zero-trust Tauri sandbox)
✅ Multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph)
✅ Voice-native PR reviews

---

6/8 The ideal workflow uses BOTH tools:

📧 Willow: Emails, Slack, rapid AI prompts (speed layer)
💻 Voco V2: Coding, architecture, PR reviews (context layer)

Think of it like this:
Willow = keyboard replacement
Voco V2 = AI memory augmentation

---

7/8 Who should use Voco V2?

✅ Developers using Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code
✅ Tech leads coordinating distributed teams
✅ DevOps engineers automating deployments
✅ Startup CTOs rapidly prototyping

If you experience context drift, Voco V2 is for you.

### Title Options
1. "Willow vs Voco V2: Why voice coding needs both speed AND context"
2. "I built a voice orchestrator to solve context drift in Cursor/Claude Code"
3. "Context drift is killing my AI coding workflow—here's my solution"

### Post Body
```
I've been using Willow for a few weeks now, and it's incredible for speeding up my workflow. Dictation is 4x faster than typing, and it works everywhere.

But I kept hitting the same wall: context drift.

I'd spend 20 minutes explaining my microservices architecture to Cursor, the AI would generate perfect code, then 30 minutes later it would forget everything and suggest breaking changes that violated my original design.

So I built Voco V2: a voice-native orchestrator with a "Logic Ledger" that tracks every architectural decision.

Here's how it's different from Willow:

**Willow:**
- Universal voice dictation (works in any app)
- 200ms latency (fastest available)
- $15/month, SOC 2/HIPAA compliant
- Perfect for emails, Slack, rapid prompts

**Voco V2:**
- Voice-native AI orchestrator (Cursor/Windsurf/Claude Code)
- <150ms latency (sub-300ms voice-to-voice)
- Logic Ledger (persistent architectural decisions)
- Multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph state machine)
- Local-first security (zero-trust Tauri sandbox)
- Voice-native PR reviews

The ideal workflow uses BOTH:
- Willow for speed (emails, Slack, rapid prompts)
- Voco V2 for context (coding, architecture, PR reviews)
