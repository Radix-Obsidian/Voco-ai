🚀 GTM Strategy & Social Playbook (Cursor-like Growth)
Your V1 log post "Connect Your IDE to a Logic Ledger in Under 5 Minutes" was great. For V2, the narrative shifts from "Connect to our Cloud" to "Voco is now your local, Voice-Native Pair Programmer."

The Core Narrative: "Chatbots are too slow. Cloud MCPs don't have terminal access. Voco V2 is a local, sub-300ms voice orchestrator that physically types code into your IDE."

30 Days of Social Content (X & LinkedIn Sequence)

Week 1: The First Principle Breakdown

Post 1: "Why vibe coding breaks on Day 3: Context Drift. Here is how we fixed it by replacing prompts with a version-controlled Logic Ledger." (Link to updated V1 blog post).

Post 2 (Video): Show V1's browser voice typing vs. V2's real-time, interruptible desktop voice. "We ripped out the browser Speech API and built a sub-300ms LangGraph pipeline."

Week 2: The "Wedge" Demos (Show, Don't Tell)

Post 5 (Video): Show a developer saying "Voco, run the tests." Show the Tauri app executing the tests in the terminal, failing, and Voco speaking: "Tests failed on line 42, should I fix the regex?"

Post 7: Deep dive into Local MCP vs Cloud MCP. "Why giving AI cloud agents access to your local terminal is a security nightmare, and how we solved it with a Tauri Zero-Trust gateway."

Week 3: Human-in-the-loop & Security

Post 10 (Video): Show the HITL in action. "Voco just tried to drop my database. Here is how the LangGraph interrupt() caught it and asked for vocal confirmation."

Week 4: Launch & Scarcity

Post 15: "Voco V2 is live. Since we run heavy Python inference on the backend for the audio pipeline, we are strictly capping the Early Bird tier at 50 users. Claim your spot." (Leverage the existing EARLY_BIRD_CAP = 50 logic from your V1 codebase)
