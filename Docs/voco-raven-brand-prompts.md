# Voco Raven Brand Assets — Image Generation Prompts

Three separate prompts for Nano Banana to generate logo, icon, and mascot assets based on the Raven embodiment analysis.

---

## 1. Contextual Logo Prompt

```
A modern, minimalist logo for "Voco" — a voice-native AI coding assistant. The design features a stylized raven silhouette integrated with circuit board patterns. The raven is perched on a horizontal line that represents both a branch and a code editor cursor line. Its beak is slightly open as if speaking, emphasizing the voice-first identity. The raven's eye is a single glowing emerald dot (#10b981). The body contains subtle geometric patterns suggesting neural network nodes. The word "Voco" appears to the right in a clean, modern sans-serif font — lowercase, with the "o" stylized as a sound wave ripple. Color palette: deep charcoal (#0f172a) background, emerald accent (#10b981), white negative space. The overall feel is professional, intelligent, and slightly edgy — suitable for a developer tool used by expert engineers. Vector-style, flat design with minimal gradients. Aspect ratio: 16:9 horizontal.

## 2. App Icon Prompt

```
A square application icon for a desktop developer tool called Voco. The icon features a raven's head in profile view, facing right, rendered in a bold geometric style. The raven's silhouette is solid charcoal (#0f172a) with sharp, angular edges suggesting precision and speed. The eye is a single glowing emerald circle (#10b981) with a subtle inner glow effect. The beak is slightly open, with a small sound wave emanating from it — three curved lines decreasing in size, also in emerald. The background is a dark gradient from charcoal to near-black. The overall shape fits within a rounded square (iOS/macOS style) with subtle depth and a soft drop shadow. The design should be instantly recognizable at small sizes (32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 512x512). Flat design with minimal detail — optimized for icon legibility. No text.

## 3. Full Mascot Illustration Prompt

```
A detailed mascot illustration of "The Voco Raven" — an intelligent, voice-native AI coding assistant embodied as a raven. The raven is perched on the corner of a floating, translucent code editor window showing faint syntax-highlighted code. Its plumage is sleek and dark with subtle iridescent purple and green highlights (like real ravens). The raven's posture is alert and ready — wings slightly unfolded as if about to take flight instantly (representing interruptibility/barge-in capability). Its beak is open mid-call, with visible sound waves rippling outward in emerald (#10b981). One talon grips a stylized wrench tool (representing MCP tool orchestration). The raven's eyes are piercing and intelligent — glowing emerald with a subtle data-stream reflection. The background is a dark, atmospheric workspace: faint outlines of a desk, a second monitor, and soft ambient light. The overall mood is: vigilant guardian, intelligent collaborator, always listening. Art style: semi-realistic digital illustration with subtle cyberpunk accents. The raven should feel like a creature that belongs in a developer's environment — not a cartoon, but a dignified, intelligent presence. Aspect ratio: 4:5 portrait.

## Design System Reference

### Colors
- **Primary Dark:** `#0f172a` (charcoal/slate)
- **Accent:** `#10b981` (voco-emerald)

### Key Symbolism to Maintain
- **Open beak + sound waves** → Voice-native identity
- **Glowing emerald eye** —> Intelligence, vigilance
- **Tool in talon** → MCP orchestration, tool-wielding capability
- **Partially spread wings** → Instant interruptibility, readiness to pivot
- **Perched on code/circuit** → Local-first, desktop territory

## Usage Notes

- **Logo:** Use in app header, marketing materials, documentation
- **Icon:** Use for system tray, desktop shortcut, app store listings
- **Mascot:** Use in onboarding screens, empty states, marketing campaigns, error pages (raven looking concerned), success states (raven with wings spread in triumph)
